<h1>Mock Convention</h1>
<p class="byline"> by Dylan McKay and Fred Andrews</p>
<p>Mock Convention is another integral event for students at Washington and Lee. The convention coincides with the presidential primaries, leading up to the general election. Students run the event and work to predict the nominee for the party out of power. Planning Mock Con is a complicated undertaking. Chairs are named three years in advance, and other positions are assigned the year before.</p>

<p>All students are encouraged to join a state delegation. They can get involved by assisting the state chairs with research, or by designing and building a float to represent their state or territory. Mock Con kicks off with a parade down Main Street in Lexington.</p>

<p>The convention itself is a two-day event usually in February. Prominent speakers from either the Republican or Democratic party address the students. The event culminates with a “roll call,” when delegates cast their votes for the candidate they believe the party out of power will ultimately choose. Mock Con is famous for its accuracy: It has correctly predicted 20 out of the last 26 nominees.</p>
